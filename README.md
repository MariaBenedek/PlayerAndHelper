# PlayerAndHelper

The basis of this project is a rudimentary role-playing application in which players are accompanied (and assisted, of course) by helpers during combat.
<br>
The project covers different ways of implementing helpers - i.e. it is mainly an introduction to the potential of enums.
<br><br>
The helpers are implemented in different ways in different packages:
<ul>
<li>object-oriented programming,</li>
<li>using enum and an enum helper class,</li>
<li>using enum only.</li>
</ul>
<br>
The tests cover all implementations, but only the helpers implemented with object-oriented programming in more detail, since the "logic" of the helpers is the same in all implementations.
<br><br>
This project is not intended to tell you which implementation is the best, the most beautiful or the most recommended - it is merely experimenting...
